# zomboid-savior
A simple savegame manager for Project Zomboid

(PZ)Savior is a simple Windows-based tool to manage savegames of [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com) by [The Indie Stone](https://pzwiki.net/w/index.php?title=The_Indie_Stone).

Primary goal is to save/load a game anytime (sort of) - I admit: It is cheating and definetly against how/what game is meant to be played by devs. But if you are no fan of permadeath fetish... 
My desire is to play the game (free) without frustration I always lost everything - as a player I love to start over again; if I descided or want to.

It was done for private purpose.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App is still in development, current version is optimized for Single player only - save-all-like scenario. Expect more soon, check TODO-list.

## Usage
Just download [it](https://github.com/vosiz/zomboid-savior/releases) and extract. Run executable.

No need to alter binaries. It is a standalone tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Preform QUICK save via "CTRL + S" when tool is running.

> [!TIP]
> (Optional) Run tool on other monitor if you have more than one to see info etc.

## Licence
Alter it as you want - if you are brave enough.

Open to make/allow fork-pull requests.

Made in WinForms by pure "nostalgia". Feel free to remake it.
