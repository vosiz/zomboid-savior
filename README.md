# zomboid-savior
A simple savegame manager for Project Zomboid

Savior is a simple Windows-based tool to manage savegames of [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com) by [The Indie Stone](https://pzwiki.net/w/index.php?title=The_Indie_Stone).

Primary goal is to save/load a game anytime (sort of) - I admit: It is cheating and definetly against how/what game is meant to be played by devs. But... if you are no fan of permadeath fetish... My desire is to play game without frustration I always lost everything... As a player I love to start over again... if I descides or want to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App is still in development, current version is optimized for Single player only - save-all-like scenario. Expect more soon.

## Usage
Just download it and extract. Run executable.

No need to alter binaries. It is a standalone tool.

> [!NOTE]
> Preform QUICK save via "CTRL + S" when tool is running.

> [!TIP]
> (Optional) Run tool on other monitor if you have more than one to see info etc.

## Licence
Alter it as you want - if you are brave enough.

Open to make/allow fork-pull requests.

Made in WinForms by pure "nostalgia". Feel free to remake it.
